This project explores the simulation of key operating system concepts encompassing CPU scheduling algorithms, the Banker's algorithm, and page replacement algorithms. Through detailed simulations, the efficiency and impact of various CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJN, RR, and Priority Scheduling are analyzed in terms of turnaround time and response time. The Banker's algorithm's role in resource allocation and deadlock avoidance is examined to underscore its significance in maintaining system stability. Additionally, page replacement algorithms including FIFO, LRU, and Optimal Page Replacement are simulated to evaluate their impact on memory management and system performance. This study provides insights into the critical nature of these operating system components in enhancing system efficiency, resource allocation, and overall system reliability.
